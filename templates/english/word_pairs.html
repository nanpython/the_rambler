        <h4>Compliment | Complement</h4>
        <blockquote>
                    <strong>Compliment</strong>: praise, admiration<br>
                    She complimented him on his language skills.<br>
                    <strong>Complement</strong>: something added to complete<br>
                    The tie is a perfect complement to a suit.

        <h4>Lose | Loose</h4>
        <blockquote>
                    <strong>Lose</strong>: misplace, fail to win, withdraw, suffer, shake off<br>
                    She often loses her things because she does not remember where she left them.<br>
                    <strong>Loose</strong>: not tight, sloppy, lax, informal<br>
                    I prefer loose clothing.
