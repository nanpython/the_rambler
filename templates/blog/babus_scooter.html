    <h3>Babu's Scooter</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
Babu's uncle often rode his bicycle with the boy to make purchases at the numerous pawn shops scattered all over Abid's and Sultan Bazaar and even in the narrow Troop Bazaar. Babu sat on the steel rod that connected the front wheel to the rest of the bicycle. He sat with his legs carefully wrapped round the vertical rod that connected with the handlebar. One day, as the uncle rode swiftly - for he was powerfully built - Babu's leg slipped and stuck in the rotating wheel. He screamed in pain. Uncle braked and carefully disentangled the foot from the spokes of the wheel. But the damage had been done. The steel spokes left an ugly gash on the tender foot and Babu wouldn't stop crying from pain. Days later when the wound healed and the matter was forgotten by Babu, the duo continued their excursions on the bicycle.

Babu wanted to graduate from a bicycle to a scooter. He wanted to own a scooter to ride. There was more power in it. It vroomed and sped away at great speeds. It had a proper cushioned seat to sit on, not a cylindrical rod to perch on. Uncle promised to buy him one. Babu had no idea what it meant to drive a motorized two-wheeler. He was hardly ten, but his uncle promised and he waited eagerly to lay his hands on one. 'Are you going to buy me a scooter?' The uncle replied, 'yes'. 'The real one?' Babu couldn't believe his luck 'Just like the one we see on the roads?' Yes, yes,' came the reply and Babu waited with the thrill of anticipation. He was going to ride a real bike. He had no idea that a real bike needed someone taller than 3 feet and must be old enough to possess a license to ride. He could not contain his thrill and often imagined zooming away; he spread his hands on the imaginary handle of the bike and turned his fist to accelerate it. He waited impatiently. Agonizingly so. Waited for the day to arrive when he would ride his dream vehicle. A last the wait was over. The day was come.

The scooter arrived. Uncle with all the trappings of a magician opened the packet and showed the content to Babu. It was a two-wheeler alright; it had a handle too. But there was no seat to sit on. There was no accelerator. No engine that made roaring sound. 'What is this thing?' His heart turned inside out. His hopes dashed to pieces. His dream shattered. He felt acutely disappointed. Even cheated. 'This,' declared his uncle, 'is your scooter,' without batting an eyelid. There was even a sense of fulfillment in his face as though he had kept his promise. But Babu knew that he had been taken for a ride. He accepted the 'gift' without further comment. It was a skate on wheels with a handle to navigate and needed pushing with one leg. A great step down indeed from the motorized version he had seen on the road.

As he 'rode' his two-wheeler, Babu grew to liking it. He became possessive and did not allow his siblings and cousins to touch it. He owned it. It was his and nobody had a right to use it. He alone would ride it. He got into quarrels and screamed whenever anyone so much as touched it, leave alone ride it.
