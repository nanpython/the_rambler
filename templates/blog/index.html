            <p>
                I have written many blog posts in Blogger and Wordpress, but never consistently. I am now blogging occassionally on my own website.

                It is eclectic, having no theme or a specific topic. Who knows you might find something that interests you?    
                </p>
                <p>
                    I penned a little about my own experiences  You may skip them altogether, for they are of the most ordinary kind.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Not just about me, but about relatives and friends as well, and then some. Sometimes I wrote about myself in the third person.
